Challenge
Implement a Node.js server that provides a RESTful API for managing a list of users. 

The server should store the users in a MySQL (mongoDB) database and should validate the request data.  ✓

The API should support the following operations:

GET /users: Retrieve a list of all users. The list should be returned in JSON format. ✓
POST /users: Create a new user. The request body should contain the user details in JSON format. The user should have the following fields:
name: The name of the user (required). ✓
email: The email address of the user (required, must be a valid email format). ✓
password: The password for the user (required, must be at least 8 characters long). ✓
GET /users/:id: Retrieve a single user by ID. The user should be returned in JSON format. ✓
PUT /users/:id: Update a single user by ID. The request body should contain the updated user details in JSON format. ✓
DELETE /users/:id: Delete a single user by ID. ✓

Requirements
The server should listen on port 3000. ✓
The API should support the above operations using the appropriate HTTP methods (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). ✓
The API should validate the request data and return appropriate error messages if the data is invalid. For example, if a POST request to create a new user is missing the required name field, the API should return a 400 Bad Request response. ✓
The API should use MySQL(mongoDB) to store and retrieve the users. You may use the MySQL(mongoDB) driver for Node.js or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like Sequelize. ✓
The API should hash the user's password before storing it in the database using a secure hashing function like bcrypt. ✓

Bonus
Add authentication to the API using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Require a valid JWT to access any of the API endpoints. ✓(desactivado)
Implement filtering, pagination, and sorting for the GET /users endpoint. Allow the client to specify query parameters to filter the users by email address ✓, to paginate through the results ✓, and to sort the results by a specific field ✓.

Additional Notes
The code should be organized into appropriate files and directories (e.g. routes in a routes directory, models in a models directory, etc.). ✓
The code should follow best practices for writing scalable and maintainable Node.js applications. ✓
You may use any npm packages you like to complete the challenge. ✓
You should implement error handling for the MySQL operations. For example, if a user is not found when attempting to retrieve or delete it, the API should return a 404 Not Found response.
You do not need to implement any kind of user registration or login functionality for this challenge. You may assume that the JWT will be provided by the client.
